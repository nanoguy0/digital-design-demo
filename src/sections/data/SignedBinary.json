  "Signed Binary Numbers": "# Signed Binary Numbers\r\n- Binary only consists of two symbols: \\`1\\` and \\`0\\`.\r\n- There is no negative sign \\`-\\` available in binary.\r\n- Signed binary numbers enable the representation of both positive and negative numbers.\r\n\r\n## Common Signed Binary Forms\r\n\r\n1. **Leading Bit and Sign Indication**\r\n   - \\`0\\` indicates a positive number.\r\n   - \\`1\\` indicates a negative number.\r\n\r\n2. **Sign-magnitude Form**\r\n   - The left-most bit indicates the sign (\\`0\\` for positive, \\`1\\` for negative).\r\n   - All remaining bits are the magnitude of the number.\r\n   - Example:\r\n     - \\`+26\\` in unsigned binary: \\`11010\\`\r\n     - \\`+26\\` in sign-magnitude: \\`0011010\\`\r\n     - \\`-26\\` in sign-magnitude: \\`1011010\\`\r\n\r\n3. **1's Complement Form**\r\n   - Positive numbers are represented the same as in unsigned binary.\r\n   - Negative numbers are the 1's complement (invert each bit of the positive number).\r\n   - Example:\r\n     - \\`+26\\` in 1's complement: \\`0011010\\`\r\n     - \\`-26\\` in 1's complement: \\`1100101\\`\r\n\r\n4. **2's Complement Form**\r\n   - Positive numbers are represented the same.\r\n   - Negative numbers are the 2's complement (invert each bit and add 1 to the least significant bit).\r\n   - Example:\r\n     - \\`+26\\` in 2's complement: \\`0011010\\`\r\n     - \\`-26\\` in 2's complement: \\`11100110\\`\r\n\r\n## 2's Complement Conversion and Range\r\n\r\n- **2's Complement Binary Conversion**\r\n  - The bit positions carry the same weight as in unsigned binary, except the leading bit has a negative weight.\r\n  - Converting to decimal:\r\n    - Assign negative weight to the leading bit (e.g., \\`-2^7\\` for an 8-bit number).\r\n    - Sum the weights corresponding to bits that are \\`1\\`.\r\n\r\n- **Range of Integers in 2's Complement**\r\n  - For \\`n\\` bits: range is from \\`-2^(n-1)\\` to \\`+2^(n-1) - 1\\`.\r\n  - For an 8-bit system:\r\n    - Smallest integer: \\`-128\\` (\\`-2^7\\`)\r\n    - Largest integer: \\`+127\\` (\\`2^7-1\\`)\r\n\r\n## The Term \"Negate\" in Binary\r\n\r\n- In decimal:\r\n  - Negate \\`58\\` gives \\`-58\\`\r\n  - Negate \\`-722\\` gives \\`+722\\`\r\n\r\n- In 2's complement binary:\r\n  - To negate, perform the 2's complement operation.\r\n  - Example: Negate \\`1110\\` becomes \\`0010\\`."
