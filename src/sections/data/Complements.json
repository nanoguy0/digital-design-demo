  "1's Complement": "## 1's Complement\r\n*(Diminished Radix Complement)*\r\n- Applies to binary numbers (and numbers in any base)\r\n- Subtract each digit of a number from the largest digit in that base\r\n- In binary:\r\n  - 1's complement is simply flipping the bits\r\n  - 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1",
  "2's Complement": "## 2's Complement \r\n*(Radix Complement)*\r\n- Defined as 1's complement + 1\r\n- Helps to represent negative numbers in binary\r\n- In binary:\r\n  - Perform 1's complement\r\n  - Add 1 to the least significant bit (LSB)\r\n  - If adding 1 causes a carry, propagate it to the left\r\n- Binary shortcut for 2's complement:\r\n  - Copy bits from right to left up to the first 1\r\n  - Beyond that, flip each bit\r\n- Note: Complement is spelled with an 'e', not with an 'i'"
